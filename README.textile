This build is based on tp3-ci-31 as of 11/10/2015.

This is a minimially tested build but basic tests were run on HBase 1.1.1, Hadoop 2.7.1 as well as Cassandra 2.1.5.
The build was recompiled with Hadoop 2.6.0 and also worked with that version.  (Running the 2.7.1 version on 2.6.0
causes read errors when reading from Hadoop in some cases).

SparkGraphComputer was tested with both HBase and Cassandra.

HBase has an intermittent problem shown below.
This problem has been reported both on the Titan forums as well as the HBase forums in the past.

```
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access method com.google.common.base.Stopwatch.<init>()V from class org.apache.hadoop.hbase.zookeeper.MetaTableLocator

```

Several packages used by Titan were updated to match newer versions used by TinkerPop 3.

The GiraphGraphComputer does not curently run.  However, this is due to problems with the TinkerPop implementation,
which does not utilize the GraphYarnClient implemetnation for Hadoop2-Yarn environments.
